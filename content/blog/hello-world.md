This is the first post on mikaana.com.

I've been meaning to set up a proper home for my projects and writing for a while. GitHub READMEs are great for documentation, but sometimes you want a place that feels a bit more intentional — somewhere to share the *why* behind the work, not just the *what*.

So here we are. Expect posts about:

- **skalp** and the HLS ecosystem I'm building
- The novel I'm writing
- Technical deep dives into things I find interesting
- Occasional notes and observations

Thanks for stopping by.
