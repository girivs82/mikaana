Hi, I'm Giri.

I design hardware and write software. Currently building [**skalp**](/projects/skalp/) — a hardware description language written in Rust that sits between RTL and HLS, with compile-time clock domain safety and progressive refinement. Also writing a novel on the side.

This site is where I share [projects](/projects/), [blog posts](/blog/), and a [tutorial](/tutorial/) on learning skalp by building a UART peripheral from scratch.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/girivs82).
