Hi, I'm Giri.

I build things with video and software. Currently working on the **skalp** ecosystem — a set of tools for HLS streaming — and writing a novel on the side.

This site is where I share projects, blog posts, and whatever else catches my attention.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/girivs82).
